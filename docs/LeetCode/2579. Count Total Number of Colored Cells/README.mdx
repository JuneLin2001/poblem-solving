    ## Description
There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:

At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.  

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/10/example-copy-2.png)

Return the number of colored cells at the end of n minutes.


#### Example 1:
Input: n = 1  
Output: 1  
Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.  

#### Example 2:
Input: n = 2  
Output: 5  
Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5. 


## Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 105
```

   ## Solution
```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var coloredCells = function (n) {
  return 2 * n * (n - 1) + 1;
};

```

## 解題思路
看了 Discussion 提到這題其實是個數學問題，套公式就能寫出時間複雜度空間複雜度皆為 O(1) 的完美答案
