    ## Description
    Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


#### Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false


## Constraints:
```
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

   ## Solution
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSubsequence = function (s, t) {
  let pointerS = 0;
  let pointerT = 0;

  if (s.length === 0) return true;

  while (pointerT <= t.length) {
    if (s[pointerS] === t[pointerT]) {
      pointerS++;
    }
    if (pointerS >= s.length) {
      return true;
    }
    pointerT++;
  }
  return false;
};

```

## 解題思路
先是定義兩個 Pointer，再用其判斷字串的是否為 Subsequence
## 心得
看了 [Wilson Ren 的 資料結構與演算法 (JavaScript)](https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithm-data-structure) 介紹這題經典題，就馬上用 Two Pointer 做法來試試看
