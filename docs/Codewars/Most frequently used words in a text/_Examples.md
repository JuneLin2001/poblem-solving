Examples:

```
"In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra
on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income."

--> ["a", "of", "on"]


"e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e"

--> ["e", "ddd", "aa"]


"  //wont won't won't"

--> ["won't", "wont"]
```

Bonus points (not really, but just for fun):

1. Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text.
2. Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.
